Originally this was supposed to be an x-ray for classic Minesweeper made while I wasn't home, but I had a much stupider idea while making it...

The video must be postprocessed with the command `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf scale=30:24:flags=neighbor frame_%d.png`, first.

The version of Minesweeper I used can be found [here](http://www.minesweeper.info/downloads/WinmineXP.html). The board must be resized to 30x24 before running the program.
